  <h2><strong><em> Medasvini's Story</em></strong></h2>
<p> <em> 45 years ago I received the name Medasvini from two Indian people who were madly in love. I had the most amazing childhood and saw two great examples in my parents. Unfortunately they passed away when I was young. I was taken in by a young woman who lived across the street from me. Years passed and I still live in that same street. I never got married and never got the honor of becoming a mother. My beautifull adoptive mother raised me to her best abilities and I could not be more thankfull to her. Our small village houses 3000 people and our street is one big family. Children's laughter can be heard down the street. I have always loved children and love taking care of them. In the village there are many poor families with small children. Some parents can’t take care of them so I gladly help them out with that. 
	
	 The work I did before Elvina was more of a voluntary job. I made shoes out of old rags for these little kids and sold them for drawings or a smile. 
  When one of the kids that I cared for got ill and needed medical attention I started working more and harder to provide him with the help he needed. When ELVINA approached me to work for them I took the job immediately. I was working 2 jobs at that time, but I realised quite quickly that I don’t need both jobs anymore. Elvina was paying me more money than I ever could imagine. I made enough money for the medical care of the poor child and with gods will recovered. Now I’m an employee for ELVINA and I never thought I would enjoy working this much! There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. Never give up!</em></p>
	  
  <h2><strong><em> Prinavi's Story</em></strong></h2>
<p> <em> My name is Prinavi. A former volunteer at a primary school in India. My husband sadly passed away around a year ago and we sadly weren’t blessed with a child. My dream is to become an artist and be known all around the country. Because I am a volunteer I don’t get paid for my teaching. As a job I clean shoes at the market. Because I love art I also offer the service of painting the shoes for people to make them more unique and special. I absolutely love doing that, though it doesn’t pay much. When I started working for ELVINA I got paid much more then I was making at the market, which was a shock to me at first. I absolutely love to work for ELVINA. They pay us well and they care about our personal lives and mental health. I was ill one time and I got paid for my sick days which I didn’t expect would happen. I love working here. The whole company feels like a big family to me.</em></p>
	  
  <h2><strong><em> Hunar's Story</em></strong></h2>
<p><em> My name is Hunar and I am 52 years old. I am one of the shoe makers at ELVINA. Before joining the ELVINA team I used to fix streets in Bangladesh, though when covid hit I sadly lost my job and my wife. We were married for 20 years and we have 2 daughters. As I had no source of income during that period of time, we couldn’t pay for our house or food and we almost lost everything. I didn’t know how to take care of my daughters anymore. I wanted to end it all and even attempted to end my own life. When I was ready to jump I looked to the right and I saw a poster that said that ELVINA was looking for employees. I called the number and got the job. I was able to take care of both of my daughters again. I was even able to send them to school! ELVINA really saved my life.</em></p>

  <h2><strong><em> Ranbir's Story</em></strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><em> Ranbir is the name given to me by my parents. I am 34 years old and live in Bangladesh. With a wife and 4 kids my life is kind of hectic. 
  Back in the day my family had their own farm. My father was taking care of the land while me and my 3 brothers would help him. When I was 23 years old my father passed away and while being the second son it was my job to take over the family farm. I got paid around €0.13 per hour which wasn’t enough to take care of a family. The whole family worked for m 13 to 18 hours a day at the farm so that we could make more money. 
  Now that I started working for ELVINA my life changed completely. I get paid much more then when I was working at the farm. One of my brothers took over the farm business and I am happy to be making more money now that I work for ELVINA. Now I can support my family.&nbsp;</em></p>
