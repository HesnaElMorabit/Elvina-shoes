      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>We use Instagram as our social media platform as 31% of the average IG users are 18-24 years old people. We want to stay connected with our target audience through our posts and interactive stories. Through hashtags, satisfying feed and interactive content we would be able to attract our audience in a relatively short period of time. 
      We post our ELVINA Fair Footwear as well as our employee life stories and bunch of fun and interactive IG stories which will make it possible to connect with our audience more. We also post customer review to share people opinions on our products.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>At first we thought that managing a social media account would be the easiest, though we really underestimated the work that goes in to it. We learned that having a clear schedule and planning is really important and we should have established that at the beginning of the project.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Starting up with a new brand is really a lot of work. I might have seen easy at first, but it really isn’t. It’s a lot of work and you need to think everything through before starting to build everything up. We really learned a lot about building a new brand and that we really can’t underestimate the process that goes into it.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>In general we did a good job during this project though there are some things that we should improve when working on such big project again. The biggest improvement for our group would be to great a plan with a clear overview and a plan. A lot of the times we were behind with some work, as we didn’t have a clear overview of what had to be done which at the end of the project. This concluded for a larger workload during the last week.
      As mentioned before, we underestimated the social media workload. We should have prepared a little better regarding what content should have been posted. This way everything would go smoother and we would have had better content to post.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p>Our first post was an introduction to our brand ELVINA. This was to introduce ourselves to our target audience. Our second post was an introduction to our vision and what we stand for as a brand. Our next three posts were the products that we created which were shoes. We created three different shoes as there are three owners of the brand so we all created our own pair of shoes. Our next posts were our solution to our brand problem – which is discount – and a customer review. Our last post was an introduction to our finished website and to announce the sale of our products. All our posts our in the brown colors from our color palette and have the same letter type which makes the whole feed feel complete and satisfying to the human eye.</p>
