      <h2><strong>Marketing</strong></h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Context of campaign and promotional activities</strong></h4>
<p>We have used Instagram as our main social media platform ,since out of the interviews we conducted ,came the conclusion that instagram was the most used app among our demographic. We want to stay connected with our target audience through our posts and interactive stories. Through hashtags, satisfying feed and interactive content we would be able to attract our audience in a relatively short period of time. 
      We post our ELVINA Fair Footwear as well as our employee life stories and other bunch of fun and interactive IG stories which makes it possible to connect with our audience more. We also post customer reviews to share people opinions on our products.
		Our goal for our social media campaign was to reach 500 people and receive 100 followers in the first 4 weeks.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Learning Points</strong></h4>
<p>At first we thought that managing a social media account would be the easiest, though we really underestimated the work that goes in to it. We learned that having a clear schedule and planning is really important and we should have established that at the beginning of the project. Working together as a group is one of the toughest challanges a young student can face. Different opinions, different outlooks of life and different time scedules. All of these factors have played a major key in our project. We started out as 3 hopefull second year students with no former website developement experience/skills but we managed to divide the tasks and learned to communicate very properly together in a proffesional setting.In the past we had troubles while working in different teams and we experienced headaches during these meetings but during the entire PRJ4 course we have found out that the three of us make a strong team. Prior teamwork ended up in shambles but we think this time around we found out that communication is key, as we strongly believe we developed a magnificient end project.&nbsp;At last, we unfortunately did not reach our goal. Our overall reach was 84, and the total amount of followers is 51.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Future Planning</strong></h4>
<p> For future projects we plan to get started on certain tasks before the next tutorials so we can get proper feedback on our work. We found out that these feedback session are vital to a succesfull project. If the campaign happened to continue we will keep a tight planning for our instagram page. Since this was such a new thing to us we did not know how to handle it in the most efficient way. For future projects we will definitely keep this in mind.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Professionalism</strong></h4>
<p>Our first post was an introduction to our brand; ELVINA. This was to introduce ourselves to our target audience. Our second post was an introduction to our vision and what we stand for as a brand. Our next three posts were the products that we created which were shoes. We created three different shoes as there are three owners of the brand so we all created our own pair of shoes. Our next posts were our solution to our brand problem – which are high priced products– and a customer review. Our last post was an introduction to our finished website and to announce the sale of our products. All the posts are from our color palette and have the same font which makes the whole feed feel complete and satisfying to the human eye. Apart from the regular instagram posts we have also created multiple (10) instagram stories. </p>
	  <h4 class="mt-4"><strong>Objectives&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<h8 class="mt-4">Reach</h8>
      <p> We want to reach a total of 500 people to see our posts in the first 4 weeks of our marketing campaign by posting on Instagram. </p>
 <h8 class="mt-4">Affect</h8>
      <p> We want our target audience to be aware of the poor working conditions of the workers who are making their shoes even when they are walking through a busy city street. We want to make them feel involved in today’s fight against working conditions even when it is something as simple as wearing the right shoes. </p>
 <h8 class="mt-4">Response</h8>
      <p> We want our target audience to engage with our social media account which will lead to 100 followers. Starting a new brand and getting loyal consumers is hard, that why we choose to start up with 100 loyal followers to build a loyal customer data base and from there we would expand to a bigger circle. </p>
